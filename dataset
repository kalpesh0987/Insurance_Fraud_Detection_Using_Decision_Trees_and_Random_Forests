# Insurance Fraud Detection Dataset Description

This document describes the dataset used in the Insurance Fraud Detection project, sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset Overview
The project uses two CSV files for training and testing machine learning models to detect insurance fraud:

- **Training Dataset**: `Insurance Fraud - TRAIN-3000.csv`
  - Size: 3,000 records
  - Purpose: Used to train Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Test Dataset**: `Insurance Fraud - TEST-12900.csv`
  - Size: 12,918 records
  - Purpose: Used to evaluate the performance of trained models.

## Source
- **Dataset Name**: "Insurance Fraud Claims"

## Features
The datasets contain a mix of numerical and categorical features related to insurance claims, with a target variable indicating whether a claim is fraudulent.

### Target Variable
- **FRAUDFOUND**: Binary variable
  - `1`: Fraudulent claim
  - `0`: Non-fraudulent claim

### Feature Types
- **Numerical Features**: Continuous or discrete values (e.g., claim amount, age)
  - Preprocessing: Mean imputation for missing values, standard scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- **Categorical Features**: Discrete categories (e.g., policy type, claim type)
  - Preprocessing: Mode imputation for missing values, one-hot encoding using `OneHotEncoder` with `handle_unknown='ignore'`.

### Total Features
- 32 columns (31 features + 1 target variable, `FRAUDFOUND`)
- Feature names are not listed here due to their number, but they include attributes related to:
  - Policyholder demographics
  - Claim details
  - Policy information
  - Incident circumstances


## Access Instructions

1. Download `Insurance Fraud - TRAIN-3000.csv` and `Insurance Fraud - TEST-12900.csv`.
2. Place the files in the project’s root directory or a `data/` subdirectory.
3. Ensure the file names match exactly as listed above to avoid errors when running the notebook.

## Notes
- **Data Quality**: The dataset may contain biases or class imbalances (e.g., fewer fraudulent claims), which could affect model performance. Users should explore the data to understand its characteristics.
- **Usage Restrictions**: Adhere to the dataset’s license terms specified on Kaggle. For questions about permissible use, refer to the Kaggle dataset page or contact the dataset owner.
- **Exclusion from Repository**: The datasets are excluded from this repository (see `.gitignore`) to comply with Kaggle’s terms and reduce repository size.

For additional details about the project, see [README.md](../README.md). For questions about the dataset, open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the project maintainer, Kalpesh Patil.
